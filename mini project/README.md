# Mini Project [A Recruitment Test for Advitiya]

## Problem Statement 
 
Integrate various sensors like GPS, barometric sensor with ATmega development board. Start with GPS sensor and move on to Barometric Sensor. Make sure the code is modular and can be expanded for other functionalities. Use the available architecture judiciously as it may be needed to expand functionality. Make a readme file and explain the data format and variables used in the code along with proper comments in the code. Make sure that the setup can be used for real time data extraction. 


The system decribed above was initially implemented on Arduino Mega followed by AVR microcontrollers
