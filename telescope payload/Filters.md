# FILTERS

A telescope such as the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope typically has a fixed number of well-defined filters.

Filters can either be broad-band (Wide) or narrow-band (Narrow). A broad-band filter lets a wide range of colours through, for instance the entire green or red area of the spectrum. A narrow-band filter typically only lets a small wavelength span through, thus effectively restricting the transmitted radiation to that coming from a given atomic transition, allowing astronomers to investigate individual atomic processes in the object.

A filename such as 502nmos.fits indicates that the filter used has a peak at 502 nm. In the table below, you can see that this filter is a narrow bandwidth filter, i.e. it only lets radiation with wavelengths within a few nm of 502 nm through.

Below is an example of an image composed from narrow-band exposures. This results in very sharply defined wisps of nebulosity since each exposure separates light from only some very specific physical processes and locations in the nebula.
