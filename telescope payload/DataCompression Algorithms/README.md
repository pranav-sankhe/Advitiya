# Data Compression Algorithms

Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images, to reduce their cost for storage or transmission. Algorithms may take advantage of visual perception and the statistical properties of image data to provide superior results compared with generic compression methods.

Image compression can be of two types: 
- lossy
- lossless

We will examine algorithms for both the above mentioned types.
